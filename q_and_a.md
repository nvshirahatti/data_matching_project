# Data Matching Project Q&A

## 1. Metrics and Optimization

### What are the metrics for your program (accuracy, etc)?

My model evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: 0.9514 (95.14% of predictions are correct)
- **Precision**: 0.9722 (97.22% of predicted matches are actual matches)
- **Recall**: 0.8537 (85.37% of actual matches are correctly identified)
- **F1 Score**: 0.9091 (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
- **ROC AUC**: 0.9873 (area under the ROC curve, indicating strong discrimination ability)

### How does your FP rate relate to trying to get more matches?

The false positive (FP) rate is inversely related to the match threshold. When we lower the threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.3), we increase the number of predicted matches but also increase the false positive rate. This creates a trade-off:

- **Higher threshold (e.g., 0.5)**: Lower FP rate, fewer matches, higher precision
- **Lower threshold (e.g., 0.3)**: Higher FP rate, more matches, lower precision

In our current implementation with a threshold of 0.5, we have 96 predicted matches out of 99 total pairs, with 3 predicted non-matches. The false positive rate is relatively low (3.7%), but we might be missing some valid matches.

### What should you optimize for and why?

The optimal metric depends on the business requirements:

1. **If accuracy is critical** (e.g., financial transactions, legal records): Optimize for precision to minimize false positives. This ensures high confidence in the matches we do make.

2. **If completeness is critical** (e.g., directory listings, search results): Optimize for recall to ensure we don't miss potential matches. This might mean accepting a higher false positive rate.

3. **If balance is needed**: Optimize for F1 score, which balances precision and recall.

For most business applications, I would recommend optimizing for F1 score with a slight bias toward precision (0.6-0.7 weight on precision) to ensure high-quality matches while still capturing a good number of potential matches.

## 2. General Approach and Scalability

### What was your general approach to this problem?

Our approach consisted of several key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple sources.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating similarity features between business pairs:
   - Name similarity using string matching
   - Address similarity using string matching
   - Category similarity using Jaccard similarity
   - Geographic distance calculation

3. **Candidate Generation**: Using hash-based matching to efficiently identify potential matches between datasets, reducing the number of comparisons needed.

4. **Model Training**: Training an XGBoost classifier on labeled data, including:
   - Positive examples (known matches)
   - Negative examples (known non-matches)
   - Special negative examples (similar names but different locations)

5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to score candidate pairs and classify them as matches or non-matches based on a probability threshold.

### How would you scale your approach to millions of POIs?

To scale this approach to millions of POIs, I would implement the following strategies:

1. **Improved Candidate Generation**:
   - Use geospatial indexing (e.g., R-tree, QuadTree) to quickly identify nearby POIs
   - Implement locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for name and address similarity
   - Use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms for faster similarity searches

2. **Distributed Processing**:
   - Implement a MapReduce or Spark-based pipeline to process data in parallel
   - Partition data geographically to enable parallel processing of different regions
   - Use a distributed database for storing intermediate results

3. **Optimized Feature Computation**:
   - Precompute and cache embeddings for names, addresses, and categories
   - Use approximate string matching algorithms for faster similarity calculations
   - Implement batch processing for feature extraction

4. **Incremental Processing**:
   - Design an incremental matching system that only processes new or updated POIs
   - Maintain an index of previously matched POIs to avoid redundant processing
   - Implement a change detection mechanism to identify which POIs need reprocessing

5. **Model Optimization**:
   - Use model compression techniques to reduce memory footprint
   - Implement online learning to update the model incrementally
   - Consider using approximate inference methods for faster predictions

## 3. Biggest Challenges

### What were the biggest challenges you faced in trying to get a high match rate?

The biggest challenges in achieving a high match rate included:

1. **Address Variations**: Different formats and spellings of the same address (e.g., "Central Expy" vs "Central Expressway") made address matching difficult.

2. **Name Ambiguity**: Common business names (e.g., "McDonald's", "Starbucks") appeared in multiple locations, requiring strong location-based disambiguation.

3. **Category Inconsistency**: Different categorization schemes between data sources made category similarity less reliable.

4. **Geographic Precision**: Some coordinates had limited precision, making distance calculations less reliable for very close locations.

5. **Special Cases**: Businesses with similar names at different locations (e.g., different branches of the same chain) required special handling to avoid false positives.

6. **Data Quality**: Inconsistent or missing data in some fields reduced the reliability of certain features.

7. **Threshold Selection**: Finding the optimal probability threshold that balanced precision and recall was challenging, as lowering the threshold to increase recall also increased false positives.

## 4. Potential Improvements

### If you could change something or get more information to try and get a higher match rate, what would it be?

To improve the match rate, I would consider the following changes:

1. **Additional Data Sources**:
   - Add phone numbers for verification
   - Include business IDs (e.g., tax IDs, business registration numbers)
   - Add social media profiles or website URLs

2. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**:
   - Use address normalization and standardization before comparison
   - Incorporate semantic similarity for categories using embeddings
   - Add temporal features (e.g., when the POI was added to each dataset)

3. **Model Improvements**:
   - Collect more training data, especially for edge cases
   - Experiment with ensemble methods combining multiple models
   - Implement a two-stage model: first a high-recall model to identify candidates, then a high-precision model to filter
   - Use active learning to identify and label the most uncertain cases

4. **Domain-Specific Rules**:
   - Add rules for handling chain businesses with multiple locations
   - Implement special handling for businesses with generic names
   - Create industry-specific matching rules for different business types

5. **Human-in-the-Loop**:
   - Implement a confidence score for each match
   - Create a review interface for low-confidence matches
   - Use feedback from human reviewers to continuously improve the model

6. **Threshold Optimization**:
   - Implement a dynamic threshold based on the distribution of match probabilities
   - Use different thresholds for different business types or regions
   - Consider a cost-based approach that weighs the cost of false positives vs. false negatives
